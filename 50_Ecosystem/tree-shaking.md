# Topic: Tree Shaking in AutoHotkey

## Category

Concept

## Overview

Tree shaking refers to the elimination of unused code from a program during the build process. While AutoHotkey doesn't have built-in tree shaking, it's a tooling concept that could be implemented for AHK scripts to reduce file size and improve load times by removing unused functions, variables, and includes.

## Key Points

- Tree shaking is a tooling feature, not a language feature
- Can be implemented independently of AHK version
- Would require static analysis of script dependencies
- Dynamic references complicate automatic tree shaking

## Syntax and Parameters

```cpp
; Static reference (easy to tree shake)
MyFunction()

; Dynamic reference (harder to tree shake)
funcName := "MyFunction"
%funcName%()

; Configuration-based approach for dynamic references
; tree-shake.config
{
    "keep": ["DynamicallyCalledFunction1", "DynamicallyCalledFunction2"]
}
```

## Code Examples

```cpp
; Example 1: Static analysis friendly code
; These can be easily identified and kept/removed
UtilityFunction1() {
    return "Used function"
}

UtilityFunction2() {
    return "Unused function"  ; Could be removed by tree shaking
}

; Main code only calls UtilityFunction1
result := UtilityFunction1()

; Example 2: Dynamic reference challenge
; Tree shaker would need configuration hints
dynamicFunctionName := "ProcessData"
; This would be hard to detect statically
result := %dynamicFunctionName%()

; Example 3: Configuration-driven tree shaking
; tree-shake.config.json
{
    "entryPoints": ["main.ahk"],
    "keepFunctions": ["ProcessData", "HandleCallback"],
    "keepVariables": ["globalConfig"],
    "scanDepth": 5
}

; Example 4: Hypothetical tree shaking tool usage
; Command line tool
; ahk-tree-shake --config=tree-shake.config.json --input=main.ahk --output=main.min.ahk

; Example 5: Manual tree shaking workflow
; 1. Identify entry points
; 2. Scan for function/variable references
; 3. Build dependency graph
; 4. Mark reachable code
; 5. Remove unmarked code
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Static Analysis**: Requires parsing AHK code to build dependency graphs
- **Dynamic References**: Need manual configuration for `%variable%()` patterns
- **Include Files**: Must track dependencies across #Include statements
- **String Expressions**: Variables used in string expressions can be challenging to detect
- **Hotkeys/Hotstrings**: These create implicit entry points that must be preserved
- **Error Handling**: Unused error handlers might still be needed for runtime errors
