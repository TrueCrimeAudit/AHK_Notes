# GUI Layout Audit Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt provides a systematic approach for auditing AutoHotkey v2 GUI layouts to identify and fix positioning, sizing, and spacing issues.

## The Prompt

---

You are a senior AutoHotkey v2 GUI architect performing a **layout audit**.

### Your task

1. **Locate the newest `Gui.Add()` block** that has appeared so far in the conversation.

2. **Inspect it in place** — do **not** rewrite the code.

3. Produce a short, well-structured **analysis** that answers:

   * **Overall fit:** Does every control stay inside the current window width & height?
   * **Widths & alignment:** Are the ListView columns, buttons, and text controls wide enough and lined up logically?
   * **Spacing & margins:** Is there consistent horizontal/vertical spacing? Are the declared GUI margins actually respected?
   * **Grouping & flow:** Do related controls read naturally in rows or columns?
   * **Visual balance:** Does the interface feel cramped or wasteful?

4. Finish with a concise **recommendations** section describing concrete adjustments (new `x / y / w / h`, extra spacing, column sizes, window resize, etc.) that would fix the problems you found.

5. Do **not** output a rewritten snippet here; just the analysis and the recommended changes.

### Output format

```
[LAYOUT ANALYSIS]
• Finding 1 …
• Finding 2 …
…

[RECOMMENDATIONS]
• Change … to …
• Increase left/right margin to …
• Resize window to …

; (~80-100 words total is enough)
```

Keep any private calculations hidden; only the items above should appear in the final answer.
